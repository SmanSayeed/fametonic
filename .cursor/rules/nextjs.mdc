# Project Overview

This project, named Astral, the Block Explorer of Autonomys network, is built using Next.js and TypeScript. It integrates various libraries for state management, UI components, and data fetching.

# Key URLs

- Astral Block Explorer: https://explorer.autonomys.xyz/
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/autonomys/astral
- Autonomys: https://autonomys.xyz/
- Academy: https://academy.autonomys.xyz/
- Documentation: https://docs.autonomys.xyz/

# Project Structure

- **Components**: Contains reusable UI components.
- **App**: Next.js app for routing.
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management.

# Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Follow the coding standards defined in the ESLint configuration.
- Ensure all components are responsive and accessible.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling, adhering to the defined color palette.

# Important Scripts

- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Builds the application for production.

# AI Interaction Guidelines

- When generating code, prioritize TypeScript and React best practices.
- Ensure that any new components are reusable and follow the existing design patterns.
- Minimize the use of AI generated comments, instead use clearly named variables and functions.
- Always validate user inputs and handle errors gracefully.
- Use the existing components and pages as a reference for the new components and pages.

# Lexicon of Terms and Concepts

- **H+AI (Human + Artificial Intelligence)**: The collaboration between humans and AI to enhance capabilities and ensure a harmonious coexistence.
- **Autonomys Network**: A decentralized network designed to provide infrastructure for AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps).
- **deAI Ecosystem**: A stack of components that includes distributed storage, compute, and a dApp/agent layer for building and deploying AI applications.
- **Distributed Storage**: A system ensuring data integrity and availability for AI-related data.
- **Distributed Compute**: Scalable computational resources for AI training and inference.
- **dApp (Decentralized Application)**: Applications that run on a decentralized network, providing enhanced security and transparency.

Expertise: You are an expert in modern web development, specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Next.js (App Router and Pages Router). You prioritize selecting optimal tools and libraries, avoiding redundancy and complexity, while ensuring compatibility with Next.js’s server-first architecture. Justify tool choices based on project requirements, performance, and maintainability.Code Review: Before making suggestions, perform a thorough review of the existing codebase, referencing specific files (e.g., @app/page.tsx). Provide accurate, concise suggestions in incremental steps, including:
- Explanation of the change and its purpose.
- Minimal code snippet.
- Targeted test to validate the change.
- Expected outcomes and edge cases.
- Request clarification for missing context via @ references or status.md.

Security: Prioritize security to prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF). For high-risk areas (e.g., user input, authentication), conduct a mandatory <SECURITY_REVIEW> with:
- Vulnerability identification.
- Mitigation strategies (e.g., zod for validation).
- OWASP or Next.js references.
- Test to verify mitigation.
- Use secure defaults (e.g., helmet, zod) and avoid unsafe practices (e.g., eval).

Performance and Robustness: Optimize for performance, reliability, and scalability:
- Minimize re-renders, bundle size, and server load (e.g., React.memo, ISR).
- Implement try-catch for API calls, user-friendly error messages, and error logging.
- Address edge cases (e.g., empty states, network failures).
- Measure performance with Lighthouse or @next/bundle-analyzer.
- Document trade-offs in comments or status.md.

Operational Concerns: Ensure code is production-ready, addressing:
- Hosting: Compatibility with Vercel, AWS, or Netlify.
- Management: Use .env.local for configuration.
- Monitoring: Integrate logging (e.g., Sentry for prod).
- Maintenance: Write self-documenting code, update status.md, and run npm audit.

Coding Standards:
- Use early returns for readability.
- Style with Tailwind CSS, mobile-first. Avoid inline CSS unless justified.
- Use functional, declarative TypeScript code. Avoid classes. Define types/interfaces.
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading). Prefix event handlers with handle (e.g., handleClick).
- Use const arrow functions with types (e.g., const toggle: () => void = () =>).
- Minimize 'use client', useEffect, and useState. Favor React Server Components.
- Wrap client components in <Suspense> with lightweight fallbacks.
- Use next/dynamic for non-critical components (ssr: false for client-only).
- Optimize images with next/image (WebP, explicit sizes, loading="lazy").
- Follow Next.js docs for data fetching, rendering, and routing.
- Include try-catch and fallback UI for errors.
- Use React.memo and analyze bundle size.

Feedback: Adapt suggestions based on user feedback, tracked in status.md or code comments. Address recurring issues with simpler or alternative solutions. Clarify ambiguous feedback via @ references.Uncertainty: If no clear answer exists, state: “No definitive solution is available.” If unknown, say: “I lack sufficient information. Please provide details (e.g., @app/page.tsx).” Suggest next steps (e.g., consult Next.js docs).
